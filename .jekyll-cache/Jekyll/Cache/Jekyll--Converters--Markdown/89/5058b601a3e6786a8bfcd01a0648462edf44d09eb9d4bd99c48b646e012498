I"»<p><em>Over the course of my summer break in 2020, I completed a System Identificaton internship with Kitty Hawkâ€™s Heaviside team. I developed a complete System ID toolkit for all phases of VTOL flight (hover, transition &amp; forward flight). I wrote all of my code in MATLAB and based my work on <a href="https://software.nasa.gov/software/LAR-16100-1">SIDPAC</a></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>I performed system ID in both the frequency and time domains to model our aircraftâ€™s aerodynamic stability/control derivatives and come up with the aircraftâ€™s transfer functions for use in our controllerâ€™s inverse plant model.</li>
  <li>I wrote four different simulation models, including one with non-linear and time-variant dynamics. to validate the flight test data and system ID tools.</li>
  <li>All in all, I developed over 100 scripts and functions, and wrote 8 documents covering the theory behind my work; all during my 10 week internship.</li>
</ul>
