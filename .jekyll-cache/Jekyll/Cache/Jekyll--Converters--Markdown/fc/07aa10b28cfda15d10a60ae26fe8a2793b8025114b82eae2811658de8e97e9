I"ƒ<p><em>Over the course of my summer break in 2020, I completed a System Identificaton internship with Kitty Hawkâ€™s Heaviside team. I developed a complete System ID toolkit for all phases of VTOL flight (hover, transition &amp; forward flight). I based my work on SIDPAC</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>I performed system ID in both the frequency and time domains to model our aircraftâ€™s aerodynamic stability/control derivatives and come up with the aircraftâ€™s transfer functions for use in our controllerâ€™s inverse plant model.</li>
  <li>I wrote four different simulation models to validate the flight test data and system ID tools.</li>
</ul>
