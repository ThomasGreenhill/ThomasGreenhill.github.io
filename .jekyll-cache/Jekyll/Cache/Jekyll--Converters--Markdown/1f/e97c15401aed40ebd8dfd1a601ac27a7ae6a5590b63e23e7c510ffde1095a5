<em>Me In the Local Newspaper During the 2019 Open Class Nationals in Hobbs, NM</em></p>

<p>I made an appearance in the local newspaper during the open class national championships in Hobbs, NM in 2019. I flew a borrowed ASW-22 BL (26.5m wingspan) glider, and came in 6th overall, with 92% of the winner’s score. Hobbs was my first national championship and I was very happy with the 6th place as such!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fun fact: the ASW-22 BL boasts a 62:1 glide ratio and has some of the world’s most flexible wings. Deflections under load at the tip often exceed 8 ft from the unloaded position! It’s also the only glider in the world that’s a dually!</p>

<em>Track Log From My First 1000km Flight: <a href="https://www.onlinecontest.org/olc-3.0/gliding/flightinfo.html?dsId=7961518">Link</a></em></p>

<p>On July 12, 2020, I flew my first 1000km flight in the 18m LS-10 ST! I took off from Nephi, UT and headed south. I turned north at Panguitch, UT (just west of Bryce Canyon Natl. Park) and followed the Wasatch Mountains north to Scofield Reservoir, where I turned south-west. I followed the Sevier lake basin almost to Nevada, where I turned around to head back to Nephi. My total flight path distance was 1032 km and I flew an average speed of 129 km/h.</p>
