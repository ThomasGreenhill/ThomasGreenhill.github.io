I"·<p><em>Over the last year or so, I have become infatuated with system dynamics, stability and control; particularly as they relate to aircraft. I have pushed myself to take graduate-level controls courses and have written several reports relating to dynamics and control of aircraft. Over the 2020 summer, I completed a System Identificaton internship with Kitty Hawkâ€™s Heaviside team.</em>

<p><em>After I complete my undergraduate eduction, I plan to pursue a masters or PhD degree in control systems/mechatronics</em></p>
