I"}<p>_Over the course of my summer break in 2020, I completed a System Identificaton internship with Kitty Hawk’s Heaviside team. I developed a complete System ID toolkit for all phases of VTOL flight (hover, transition &amp; forward flight). I based my work on SIDPAC _</p>
<ul>
  <li>I performed system ID in both the frequency and time domains to model our aircraft’s aerodynamic stability/control derivatives and come up with the aircraft’s transfer functions for use in our controller’s inverse plant model.</li>
  <li>I wrote four different simulation models to validate the flight test data and system ID tools.</li>
</ul>
