I"ß<p><em>Over the last year or so, I have found a new passion in system dynamics, stability and control; particularly as they relate to aircraft. I have pushed myself to take graduate-level controls courses and have written several reports relating to dynamics and control of aircraft. Over the 2020 summer, I completed a System Identificaton internship with Kitty Hawkâ€™s Heaviside team.</em></p>
