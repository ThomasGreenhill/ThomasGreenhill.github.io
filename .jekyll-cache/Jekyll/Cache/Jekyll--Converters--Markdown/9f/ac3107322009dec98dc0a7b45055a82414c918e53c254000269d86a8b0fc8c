<em>Me In the Local Newspaper During the 2019 Open Class Nationals in Hobbs, NM</em></p>

<p>I made an appearance in the local newspaper during the open class national championships in Hobbs, NM in 2019. I flew a borrowed ASW-22 BL (26.5m wingspan) glider, and came in 6th overall, with 92% of the winnerâ€™s score. Hobbs was my first national championship and I was very happy with the 6th place as such!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fun fact: the ASW-22 BL boasts a 62:1 glide ratio and has some of the worldâ€™s most flexible wings. Deflections under load at the tip often exceed 8 ft from the unloaded position! Itâ€™s also the only glider in the world thatâ€™s a dually!</p>

<em>Track Log From My First 1000km Flight</em></p>

This piece is inspired by the famous wood artist Andrei Muntian, who built a similar design with two varieties of wood. Little did I know that adding a third wood variety would make the project four times more difficult! I spent almost an entire year from the initial conception to the completion of four of these boards.</p>

<em>Chery Bedside Table: Trimetric View</em></p>

<p>When my younger brother and I shared a room together in high school, the end of his bed came very close to the end of my bed, and no off-the-shelf nightstand tables would fit in the small gap between the two beds. This narrow cherry bedside table was my solution to the problem! Its slim, elegant design enables it to fit perfectly between the two beds and it serves its purpose brilliantly!</p>

<p>Over the years, I have bult many bowls and trays. The trays are made entirely by hand with a mallette and chisel, whereas the bowls are made with a manual lathe.</p>
